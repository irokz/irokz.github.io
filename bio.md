## My Bio

I live in Iwakuni with my wife and it's pretty great.

I am currently studying for my Bachelors in either Computer Science or Cyber Security, I have yet to full decide.

I am a certified Open Water SCUBA diver through [NAUI](https://www.naui.org/) but I haven't been on a dive in years unfortunately.

I was in the Navy for four years prior to meeting my wife and she joined in 2017. 

The ship is was on was the [USS Boxer LHD-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Boxer_(LHD-4))
