<h1>Freedom</h1>

<h4>Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose</h4>
<p>-- Janis Joplin</p>

<h4>The chains that keep us from freedom are bad experiences of the past,
    good experiences of the past, fears and anxieties about the future, 
    ambitions for the future, clinging to present things, and delusions about our own importance.</h4>
<p>-- Anthony DeMello</p>

<h3>Freedom is up to interpretation.
